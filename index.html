      <h2>Remodeling Homes (since 1989)</h2>
      <p>
        Choose the word you like best--remodel, renovate, refurbish--the end result is the same--a fresh look, a more
        functional home, a better feel, and more comfort. The thought of remodeling (or renovating or refurbishing may
        be intimidating, but putting in a new window, painting a wall, laying a wood floor, installing a new sink, or
        even adding new door knobs are all examples of remodeling.
      </p>


      <h2>Big or small, I do it all.</h2>
      <p>
        You love your home. It's your castle, your refuge, your hide-away, your place for making and storing memories.
        Next to your health and well-being, your home is your biggest investment and you want to protect it.
      </p>

      <h2>Home--life done here!</h2>
      <p>
        Homes, like health and fitness, can deteriorate if not cared for. You can choose the "If it ain't broke, don't
        fix it" approach and you'll get by, for a while, but inevitably you'll pay for deferred maintenance. Regular
        maintenance, along with regular upgrades, are the path to comfortable living.
      </p>


      <h2>Getting it done...</h2>
      <p>
        It isn't difficult to choose a new stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, floor covering, wall texture and color,
        lighting fixtures, and... Or is it? Sometimes the process can feel overwhelming and that "one more decision" is
        the final straw that breaks your back. Why suffer? As a remodeling professional I can ease the discomfort. I'll
        give you an assessment of what you're starting with, help you avoid costly mistakes, put together a realistic
        price estimate, and alert you to possible pitfalls.

      </p>
